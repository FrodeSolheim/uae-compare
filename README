uae-compare is a small utility to compare different UAE projects. The utility
supports comparing FS-UAE, WinUAE and PUAE (adding support for other
projects is trivial).

uae-compare normalizes file names between the different UAE, and also
processes the source code files with a code cleanup tool - in order to
remove insigificant differences such as white space or slightly different
code formatting.

Requirements:
- python
- astyle

Optional:
- meld diff viewer (nice viewer with support for three-way compares)

Just run "make" to start processing. The directories "WinUAE", "FS-UAE",
and "PUAE" must exist alongside this directory. The processed files will
be stored in WinUAE, FS-UAE and PUAE within this directory.

To open a three-way compare in meld for the source file newcpu.c, run:

./compare newcpu.c

You can also just run your favorite diff viewer manually, perhaps in even
directory diff mode.

Of course, it only makes sense to compare common files, so many files
specific to different UAE flavors are not included in the comparison.
